# 🧪 100 Days of DevOps – Day 3  
## ✅ Task 3: Disable Direct SSH Root Login on All App Servers

---

### 📝 Task Description

Your task is to **disable direct SSH root login** on **all App Servers** within the Stratos Datacenter:
- `stapp01`
- `stapp02`
- `stapp03`

This is a common security practice to prevent unauthorized root access via SSH.

---

### 🔁 Step 1: SSH into Each App Server One by One

From the jump host, connect to each app server:

```bash
ssh tony@stapp01     # App Server 1
ssh steve@stapp02    # App Server 2
ssh banner@stapp03   # App Server 3
```

> Use the credentials provided in the KodeKloud environment. Confirm with yes if prompted.

---

### 🛠️ Step 2: Edit the SSH Configuration File
On each server, open the SSH config file:

```bash
sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

| Part                  | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `sudo`                | Runs the command with superuser (root) privileges — necessary to edit system files. |
| `vi`                  | Launches the `vi` text editor (or `vim`, if available).                     |
| `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`| Opens the SSH daemon configuration file for editing.                        |


Locate the line:

```bash
#PermitRootLogin yes
```

Change it to:

```bash
#PermitRootLogin no
```

> 📝 If the line is commented `(#)`, remove the `#`.
> If the line doesn’t exist, add it manually at the end of the file.

---

### 💾 Step 3: Save and Exit
In `vi`, press:
- `Esc`
- Type `:wq`
- Press `Enter`

---

### 🔄 Step 4: Restart the SSH Service
Run the following command to apply changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```

|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `sudo`                 | Runs the command with superuser (root) privileges — required to manage system services. |
| `systemctl`            | A utility used to examine and control the `systemd` system and service manager. |
| `restart`              | Tells `systemctl` to **stop and then start** the specified service.          |
| `sshd`                 | Refers to the **SSH daemon** — the background service that handles incoming SSH connections. |


> ✅ Repeat Steps 2–4 on all three app servers.

---

### 🔍 Step 5: Verify the Change (Optional)
To confirm the change:

```bash
sudo grep PermitRootLogin /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

> Description:

| Part              | Description                                                                                                                      |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `sudo`            | Runs the command with superuser (root) privileges. Required because `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` is a system configuration file that may be restricted to root access. |
| `grep`            | A command-line utility that searches for lines that match a pattern.                                                             |
| `PermitRootLogin` | This is the pattern `grep` is looking for — specifically, lines containing the text `"PermitRootLogin"`.                         |
| `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` | The file being searched — this is the SSH server configuration file, which controls how the SSH daemon (`sshd`) behaves.    |


Expected output:

```bash
PermitRootLogin no
```
