# 🚀 AWS Task: Create IAM Role for EC2 (Console Method)

## 🧩 Scenario

While configuring AWS infrastructure, the **Nautilus DevOps Team** is setting up IAM roles to allow AWS services to securely access other AWS resources.

IAM **Roles** are used when permissions must be granted to AWS services (like EC2) instead of individual users.

# 🎯 Objective

Create an IAM Role with the following configuration:

| Setting | Value |
|--------|------|
| Role Name | `iamrole_anita` |
| Trusted Entity | AWS Service |
| Use Case | EC2 |
| Attached Policy | `iampolicy_anita` |
| Region | `us-east-1` *(IAM is global)* |

# 🧭 Step 1 — Login to AWS Console

1. Open the provided **AWS Console URL**.
2. Sign in using the supplied credentials.
3. Verify the region (top-right corner):
```text

```

> ✅ IAM is a global service, but always follow the required lab region.

1. In the AWS search bar, type:
```text

# 💡 Key Concepts

## IAM Role vs IAM User

| IAM User | IAM Role |
|---------|----------|
| Represents a person/app | Represents a service |
| Long-term credentials | Temporary credentials |
| Manual login | Assumed automatically |

### How it works
EC2 Instance → Assumes Role → Gets Policy Permissions
```
