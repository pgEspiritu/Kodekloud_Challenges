# 🚀 AWS Incremental Migration Task  
## 🔐 Create an EC2 Key Pair via AWS Console (us-east-1)

---

## 🧩 Problem Overview

The **Nautilus DevOps Team** is migrating a portion of their infrastructure to the **:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0} (AWS)** cloud using an **incremental migration strategy**.

Instead of executing one large migration, the team breaks the process into **smaller, manageable tasks** to:

- Reduce operational and security risks  
- Maintain better visibility and control  
- Minimize disruption to live services  
- Optimize cloud resource usage

## 🎯 Task Objective

Create an **EC2 Key Pair** with the following requirements:

| Requirement | Value |
|------------|------|
| **Key Pair Name** | `nautilus-kp` |
| **Key Pair Type** | `RSA` |
| **Region** | `us-east-1` |
| **Method** | AWS Management Console |

---

## 🔑 AWS Credentials (Provided)

> ⚠️ **Important:** Credentials are **temporary** and valid only within the specified window.

| Field | Value |

### Step 2️⃣: Confirm the AWS Region
1. Look at the **region selector** in the top-right corner.
2. Ensure the region is set to:
```text
us-east-1 (N. Virginia)
```

---

### Step 6️⃣: Download the Private Key
1. Click **Create key pair**.
2. The file `nautilus-kp.pem` will be downloaded automatically.
3. Store the file in a **secure location**.

> ⚠️ **Important:** AWS does **not** allow private keys to be re-downloaded.

---

### Step 7️⃣: Verify Key Pair Creation
1. Ensure `nautilus-kp` appears in the **Key Pairs** list.
2. Confirm:
   - **Type:** RSA  
   - **Status:** Available  

![Day 1 - Create a Key Pair.6](images/Day-001.6.png)

or using CLI in the KodeCloud Terminal:
```bash
aws ec2 describe-key-pairs --region us-east-1
```

## ✅ Final Validation Checklist

- [x] Key pair name is `nautilus-kp`  
- [x] Key type is **RSA**  
- [x] Created in **us-east-1** region  
- [x] Private key downloaded and secured
