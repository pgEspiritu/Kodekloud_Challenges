# 🚀 AWS Incremental Migration Task  
## 🌐 Create a Subnet in Default VPC (us-east-1)

---

## 🧩 Problem Overview

The **Nautilus DevOps Team** is migrating a portion of their infrastructure to **:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0} (AWS)** using an **incremental approach** rather than a single large migration.  

This strategy helps the team:
- Reduce migration risk  
- Maintain operational stability  
- Execute changes in controlled phases  

As part of this phased migration, a new **subnet** must be created.

|------------|------|
| **Subnet Name** | `devops-subnet` |
| **VPC** | Default VPC |
| **Region** | `us-east-1` |
| **Method** | AWS Management Console |
